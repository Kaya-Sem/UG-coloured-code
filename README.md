# UG-coloured-code

This repository builds upon the basic principles outlined in [UGent's official style guide](https://styleguide.ugent.be/basic-principles/colours.html), expanding its color palette to create an accessible set of colors tailored for code. The palette is designed with clarity and readability in mind, providing teachers with a standardized, visually pleasing color scheme that aligns with UGentâ€™s branding guidelines while ensuring optimal code legibility across different platforms and environments.
